<div class="building about"> 
<p>Hi I'm Keith! I am an Artist, Designer, Illustrator, Educator, Web Developer and lover of Cats. 
I am from Dublin in Ireland. I Graduated from NCAD in 2006 with a BA in Art & Design Education, with a
specialism in Graphic Design, though I always took a "Fine Art" methodology to my work</p>
<p>In 2012 I returned to study Web Technologies in NCI part-time, building on my graphic design skills</h2>

<h2>About the Art</h2>
<p>My work is a little bit quirky, and a lot of fun! I use an Illustrative style in all my approaches, and aim to
make anything I produce playful and fun to approach.<p>
I base some of my personal work on the
world around me, whether it is interactions with others, past
experiences, or the city I live in. I also paint cats and bees that shoot lasers from their eyes</p>
